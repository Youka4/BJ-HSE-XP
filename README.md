# Blackjack Desktop Game

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a desktop application for playing Blackjack with a simple graphical user interface (GUI). The application supports two game modes:
1. **Single Player**: Play against a dealer (bot), where the user competes against an automated opponent.
2. **Two Player Mode**: Play with two players on the same device.
