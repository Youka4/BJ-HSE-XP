# Technical Requirements for "Blackjack Desktop Game" Project

## 1. Objective
The goal of this project is to create a desktop application for playing Blackjack with a simple graphical user interface (GUI). The application should support two game modes: a single-player mode against a dealer (bot) and a two-player mode on the same device. The application should be lightweight, cross-platform, and easy to maintain.

## 2. Technology Stack

### 2.1 Programming Language

**Python** is selected as the primary programming language due to:
- Its ease of use and rapid development cycle.
- Cross-platform support, allowing the application to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- A wide range of libraries available for GUI, testing, and automation, which facilitate XP practices.

### 2.2 Graphical User Interface (GUI)

**Tkinter** is chosen for building the GUI:
- **Tkinter** is a standard Python library that enables the creation of simple and functional GUI applications. It requires no additional dependencies and is ideal for rapid prototyping.
- **PyQt** or **Kivy** are alternatives if more advanced functionality is needed. However, Tkinter is preferred due to its lightweight nature, aligning with the project's simplicity requirements.

### 2.3 Version Control and Project Management

**Git** for version control and **GitHub** (or **GitLab/Bitbucket** as needed) for code repository and documentation:
- **Git** provides flexibility in version management, collaborative development, and supports frequent releases.
- **GitHub/GitLab** facilitates code review, documentation, and task management, simplifying pair programming and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

### 2.4 Extreme Programming (XP) Practices

1. **Frequent Releases**: GitHub’s release feature will be used to mark progress after each development milestone.
2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Pytest will be employed for writing and automating tests. Pytest:
   - Supports unit tests, integrates easily with CI/CD, and automatically discovers test files based on naming conventions.
3. **Pair Programming**: Git and GitHub/GitLab support code comments and reviews, enhancing collaborative work and enabling effective pair programming.
4. **Simple Design**: Tkinter’s minimalistic design aligns well with the project's requirement for a simple and intuitive user interface.

### 2.5 Testing

- **Pytest**: for creating unit tests to verify game logic and interface functionality. Pytest is suitable for TDD, easily readable, and allows for modular testing.
- **Mock** (from Python’s `unittest.mock` library): for creating substitute objects to test the dealer bot’s behavior and event handling.

### 2.6 Documentation and Project Description

- **Markdown**: for creating a README file and additional documentation. Markdown’s simplicity and readability on GitHub make it ideal for open-source projects.
- **Sphinx**: optionally, for generating in-depth code documentation and HTML pages if needed.

---

## 3. Minimum System Requirements

- **Operating Systems**: Windows, macOS, Linux.
- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher.
- **Libraries**:
  - Tkinter (included in Python’s standard library).
  - Pytest for testing (`pip install pytest`).
  - Optionally, Sphinx for documentation (`pip install sphinx`).

---

## 4. System Requirements and Usage Considerations

- **Lightweight Application**: The application should remain lightweight with a simple installation process.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The application should function properly across all major operating systems.
- **Ease of Use**: The GUI should be intuitive and straightforward, requiring no prior user training.

## 5. Conclusion

The selected technology stack offers a reliable and maintainable architecture, enabling adherence to XP principles and ensuring high code quality. This setup facilitates a streamlined development process and provides accessibility for a broad audience.
